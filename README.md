Code base for the stock market prediction algorithm using R

This model uses past data, financial as well as monetary factors which define the market conditions at a particular period of time to predict the returns of the IT stocks of BSE Sensex.
Along with these parameters more parameters are derived from the time series analysis of the returns for the last 120 days. The parameters derived from time series analysis improve the performance of the model by almost 15%.
The output of the model is measured in terms of returns and the performance is measured in terms of mean absolute error of the returns.
Also the trend indicating the movement of the stock price is also measured which helps in measuring the performance in terms of movement as well as in terms of returns.
